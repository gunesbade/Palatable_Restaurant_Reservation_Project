# Palatable Restaurant Reservation Project

A web-based restaurant reservation system named **Palatable**, designed to allow users to book tables, choose seating areas, and complete payment through an interactive multi-page interface. The system also includes admin functionality to manage reservations and menu content.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Page structure
- **CSS** – Styling via `main.css` and `styles.css`
- **JavaScript** – Table selection logic
- **Browser-based (no backend/server)**
